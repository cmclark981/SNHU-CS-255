# SNHU-CS-255

This is a repository for my CS-255 class at SNHU. 

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass system is a driver education system that is based online. It provides students with study materials, driver training
and testing. The client is the company owner (Liam). He feels there is a need in the market to provide online driver education. THis system is
a web based, cloud hosted, online classroom for driver education. Students have access to educational resources and driver training services
to prepare them for the drivers exam. 

What did you do particularly well?

I feel my strength for this assignment was in the UML diagrams. I find those diagrams to be of utmost importance in designing and implementing any new system. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would probably add more detail to the use case diagram and spend more time getting the sequence diagram the way I wanted it. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Every business requirement was met based on what the client needed. User needs were determined based on the client's description of the type of users they wanted 
to attract. The users have access to training documentation, driver training scheduling and inline exams. There is adminidtrative help and a FAQ page available. The user's needs
are important to consider when designing a system because we are ultimately designing ti for them. If the system does not meet the needs of the user, then the project will fail. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The standard object oriented approach has worked for me throughout this program. Using an iterative design sstragety is a good way to stay on top of the project and
deal with changes or errors as you go along. I intend to use client interviews more and develop better UML diagrams in the future.
